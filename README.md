### The post-analysis-tools developement
This modern period of science has been described as the post-genomic era, where all available sources of information are explored at the biological systems level. This is in stark contrast to the older genocentric view, which sought to describe simple links connecting individual genes to particular phenotypes. Considering then the many genes which may contribute to disease, it is understandable that modern attempts to associate phenotypes with genetic variations do so on a genomic scale, using interactome, especially in the case of complex diseases, such as cancer, tuberculosis, etc.

#### 1. Present status
The present version implements two main objects, critical to post-analyses, network generator and semantic similarity tools:

   > Integrated Human Protein-Protein Interaction Network Generator: [IHP-PING](https://github.com/gkm-software-dev/post-analysis-tools/tree/master/ihp-ping-dev)
   >
   > Python library implementing Semantic Similarity Measures \[Library\]: [PySML](https://github.com/gkm-software-dev/post-analysis-tools/tree/master/pysml-dev)

All the post-analysis-tools functions and methods have been documented in a PDF manual, providing a more user-friendly starting point on admininstration and usage.

#### 2. History and release version

The post-analysis-tools development was initially written by Gaston K. Mazandu and collaborators. In addition, a large group of individuals is contributing to post-analysis-tools by sending suggestions and bug reports.

Since mid-2015 there has been a core group who worked on initial core of the post-analysis-tools code archive. This file has been revised since the release of the A-DaGO-Fun tool in 2015. The new releases and associated versions are provided below:
<pre>
   - v2.4.1: The IHP-PING package.
   - v2.5.1: The PySML library.
</pre>
