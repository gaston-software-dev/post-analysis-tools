### The IHP-PING Package

A repository of python modules for easing integration of existing human PPI datasets from multiple sources into a unified PPI network on-the-fly (in real time), which is stored locally for further user applications. This provides a platform that enables the retrieval of human PPI datasets stored in different online resources and produced a real time up-to-date integrated human PPI network with increased accuracy, confidence and coverage. IHP-PING retrieves human PPI datasets from eight different resources (Refer to the [PDF manual](http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ITGOM/post-analysis-tools/ihp-ping-dev/IHP-PING_Manual_2020.pdf) for details).

### Tool administration and usage
textsf{IHP-PING} contains one main module and one main folder containing modules required for generating an integrated human PPI network and formatting results to be written into a file.

#### 1. Requirements
IHP-PING v2.4.1 requires Python &ge; 2.7), requiring the installation of the NCBI BLAST software locally when retrieving interactions predicted from sequence data. It also requires the selenium Python package, as well as chromedriver and chromium-browser, for retrieving the DIP dataset. These needs to be installed prior to the use of IHP-PING. It is worth noting that IHP-PING is an adaptable, portable and expandable Python resource that can run on any computer and any operating system provided that the computer runs Python and satisfies the requirements, but it has been tested only on Linux (ubuntu).

#### 2. Quick start guide
Please refer to the [PDF reference manual](http://web.cbio.uct.ac.za/ITGOM/post-analysis-tools/ihp-ping-dev/IHP-PING_Manual_2020.pdf) on how to download or clone the IHP-PING package. **IHP-PING** is run using the following one line command:
<pre>
     python ihppinbuilder.py -r resources -o outputfolder -i outputProtID -f outputfileformat
</pre>
As illustrations:
<pre>
     python ihppinbuilder.py  -f csv
     python ihppinbuilder.py  -r stringdb biogrid dip -i genename -f csv2
</pre>
The first command generates a unified human PPI network derived from all sources under consideration currently, and save under the working directory (default) in csv format. Similarly, for the second command, only STRING, BioGrid and DIP databases are used and the network is saved as a csv2 (semi-column separated value) file with the gene name ID system.
